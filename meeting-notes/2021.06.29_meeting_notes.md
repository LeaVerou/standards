## Agenda

### Announcements

*Extracted from **cross-project-council-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **openjs-foundation org** prior to the meeting.

### openjs-foundation/standards

* Requesting 10 minutes to discuss API translation effort [#144](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/144)
Discussion held in the last Standards WG meeting. Follow ups will be noted in the issue.

* Request to attend TC39 as OpenJS delegate [#143](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/143)
Private session discussion.

* Document Delegates & Delegate Approval Process [#142](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/142)
Defining terms a work in progress. People often represent more than one organization - “wear different hats.”
Start by listing all OpenJS participants who participate in standards. See PR #148 - this is meant to be all standards-adjacent people.
How do we index - by person or organization? Consensus is both, although list by person and include their affiliation -- people often continue their standards participant roles even when switching companies.
To determine status on representation, file an issue to be approved to be affiliated with OpenJS.
